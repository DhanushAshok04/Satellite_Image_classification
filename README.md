**#Satellite Image Classification using Deep Learning (CNN Model)**
This project aims to classify satellite images into various land types such as land, cloud, desert, and forest using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The goal is to provide an automated solution for identifying different types of land cover from satellite imagery, useful for environmental monitoring, agriculture, urban planning, and more.

Project Overview
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model that excels at image recognition tasks, to classify satellite images into the following categories:

Land: General land surfaces such as plains, mountains, etc.
Cloud: Areas covered by clouds.
Desert: Sandy, arid regions.
Forest: Dense vegetative areas.
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing this model contains labeled satellite images. Each image is categorized into one of the classes mentioned above. The dataset is divided into two main parts:

Training set: Used to train the model.
Test set: Used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
You can use publicly available datasets IN Kaggle
